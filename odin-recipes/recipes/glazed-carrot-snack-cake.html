  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Cake</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>baking spray with flour</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups grated carrots</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped, toasted walnuts, plus more for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Carrot Glaze</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup carrot juice (such as Lakewood Organic)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9-inch round cake pan with baking spray.
      Line bottom with parchment paper and lightly coat paper with baking spray; set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the cake: Beat together eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, ginger, salt, cinnamon,
      and baking soda in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until thick, pale,
      and slightly increased in volume, about 3 minutes.
      With mixer on medium speed, gradually add melted butter, beating until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Fold in flour until just combined. Gently fold in carrots and walnuts until evenly distributed, being careful to not overmix.</li>
    <li>Transfer batter to the prepared pan and spread into even layer with a small offset spatula.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45  to 50 minutes.
      Let cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Release from pan and remove and discard parchment.
      Let cool completely on wire rack, about 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Prepare the carrot glaze: Place sugar, carrot juice, cream, and salt in a large saucepan.
      Cook over medium-high heat, gently swirling pan occasionally, until mixture is thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.
      Remove from heat and stir in butter until combined. Let cool, undisturbed, for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place cake on a plate. Stir glaze well and pour over the center of the cooled cake,
      spreading gently to edges with a small offset spatula.
      Garnish with additional walnuts.</li>
  </ol>
